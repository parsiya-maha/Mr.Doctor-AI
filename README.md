# **Mr.Doctor - AI** repository


We have used several repositories for our project to control the **Mr.Doctor** project space.
In fact, we have divided our project into several parts.

In the repositories related to the **Mr.Doctor** project, we may have used the AI folder, which is empty.
Your task is to put the files of this repository into the AI folder.
